# Arithmetic operators
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a // b) # floor division, Quiescent
print(a ** b) # exponentiation, a to the power of b
print(a % b) # modules ,remainder of the division

# Comparison operators
a = 10
b = 5
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# Logical operators: and, or

# Identity operators: is, is not

# Membership operators: in, not in
